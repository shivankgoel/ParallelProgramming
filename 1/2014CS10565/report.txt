1)Data Structure
a)	A struct having two longs 
		int value 
		int fromleft
	Initially the values from file are stored in value attribute
	Finally we get ans in fromleft attribute

2) 
Optimum threads 4
No. of cores 4

3) 
I am creating an array of the struct mentioned in (1)
I am passing a different struct element to threads with following data
a) int threadid
b) pointer to array of struct
c) int diff, stating the difference between two nodes on which computation is done

4) 
I am building a inplace tree which is traversed twice bottom-up and top down.(http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~djg/teachingMaterials/spac)
a) Span is O(logn) , work is O(n)
b) I am creating n/2 threads where n is number of nodes at a particular level.
c) If allowed threads < n/2 say x then I am waiting for x threads to return and then start executing for n/2-x threads of that level i.e a sequential step.
d) After each level also I am waiting for all threads so that complete evaluation of that level is done.

5) 
Due to tree structure load is equally balanced among all active threads. A level with n nodes has only n/2 active threads. If allowed threads are lesser than also all active threads have equal load due to data parallelism.
